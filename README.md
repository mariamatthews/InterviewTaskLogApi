# InterviewTaskLogAPI

Hi and welcome. This is a readme file for the Git repository I have created using stackedit.io which has allowed me to write in Markup quickly in a easily readable format.

**TASK**: "Using .NET, develop a microservice exposing an API that writes log messages from external services to a text file. The messages are to include an id, a date and up to 255 characters of text."

**Completion Time (including videos, documentation): 2 days**
